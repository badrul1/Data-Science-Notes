## About Me

My name is Badrul Alom. Born in the UK and interested in all things that fall under the analytics/data science umbrella.

I've worn many hats during my career - computer programmer, database developer, operational researcher, government statistician, financial modeller. Right now I'm enrolled on an MSc. in Data Science at UCL and will soon add machine learning to my area of specialism (something that I was quite interested during my undergradute days when programming and machine learning were not as cool as they are now). 

Some career highlights (chronological order):
* Created a version of the Snake Game in Microsoft Excel and then used a artifical nerural network (EasyNN) to learn to play it.
* Created a C# application for managing reports in the Oil & Gas industry 
* Developed a Monte-Carlo financial model to estimate the costs of a new venture in the higher education as well as power & utilities sector
* Computed Contextualized Value Added scores for the Department of Education (I didn't come up with the methodology I hasten to add)
* Created numerous(!) Excel/VBA/Database/Powerpivot solutions for corporate finance
* Created a SQL Server financial reporting tool for M&A (Divestitures specifically)
* Investigated the application of analytics within a global "Big 4" consultancy
* Devised and implemented a global Spotfire training program
